### Hello world!

- 👀 I'm actively looking for a full-time front-end or full-stack development position. I'm an experienced IT professional looking to move into a development role, and have a lot of value to offer from both a web development and systems administration perspective. 
- 💻 I'm currently working on sharpening my front-end skills through a number of projects currently in private repos that will be deployed in the coming months!
- 🏫 I'm currently learning more about design principles, trends, and ways to implement them in my work. 
- 📚 I'm currently reading ...too many books at once, as is tradition. The big 3 in the rotation currently are [Another Brooklyn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27213163-another-brooklyn), [The Fall of Hyperion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77565.The_Fall_of_Hyperion), and [A People's History of the United States](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2767.A_People_s_History_of_the_United_States)
- 🏢 I'm looking to collaborate on anything! Reach out! 
- 🎮 I'm currently playing Dark Souls 3, and I swear I'm gonna get through it this time. 
- 📧 I'm reachable at jpmckenna90@gmail.com as well as [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-mckenna-88936b104/)
